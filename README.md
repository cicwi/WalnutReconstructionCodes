This is a collection of Python and MATLAB scripts for loading, pre-processing and 
reconstructing X-ray CT projection data of 42 walnuts as described in

* `FDKReconstruction.m` and `FDKReconstruction.py` compute FDK reconstructions for data from a single source-detector orbit, which leads to high cone angle artifacts.
* `GroundTruthReconstruction.m` and `GroundTruthReconstruction.py` compute an iterative reconstructions using the data from all three source-detector orbits, which leads to a reconstruction free of high cone angle artifacts.
* The complete data setÂ can be found via the following links: [1-8](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2686725), [9-16](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2686970), [17-24](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687386), [25-32](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687634), [33-37](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2687896), [38-42](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2688111).

## Requirements

* To use the scrips, you will either need the the [ASTRA toolbox](https://www.astra-toolbox.com/) more recent than v2.1 or it's development version more recent than 1.9.0dev. If you are using conda, the latter is available through the `astra-toolbox/label/dev` channel.
* `GroundTruthReconstruction.m` makes use of the [SPOT toolbox](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spot/).
